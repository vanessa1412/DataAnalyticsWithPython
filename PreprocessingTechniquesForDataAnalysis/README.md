# Employee Data Preprocessing

## Project Overview

This project focuses on preprocessing a dataset containing employee data from a fictitious company. The company conducted a psychometric test for all employees and collected data on age, gender, education level, and salary. The goal of this project is to prepare the data for analysis by identifying and addressing common data issues.

## Dataset

The dataset includes the following variables:

- **Age:** Employee's age
- **Gender:** Employee's gender
- **Education Level:** Employee's level of education
- **Salary:** Employee's salary
- **Psychometric Test Results:** Results from a psychometric test conducted by the company

The data, while fictional, is designed to represent real-world business problems.

## Objectives

1. **Data Exploration:** Understand the structure and content of the dataset.
2. **Data Cleaning:** Identify and address issues such as missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.
3. **Statistical Analysis:** Perform correlations, associations, distribution analysis, and statistical tests such as ANOVA, Shapiro-Wilk, and Chi-Square.

## Analysis Techniques

Throughout this project, the following techniques were applied:

- **Correlation Analysis:** Examined relationships between variables.
- **Association Analysis:** Explored associations between categorical variables.
- **Distribution Analysis:** Analyzed the distribution of data to understand its characteristics.
- **Statistical Tests:** Conducted ANOVA, Shapiro-Wilk, and Chi-Square tests to assess statistical significance and distribution normality.
